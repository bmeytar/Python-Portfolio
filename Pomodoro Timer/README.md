Creating a graphic user interface to create a Pomodoro timer.
The Pomodoro technique alternates between 25 minutes work and short 5 minutes break until the work section has been repeated 4 time, 
which then leads to a long 20 minutes break.

Starting the timer initiates the first work segment.

When the timer reaches zero, it switches to the first 5 minutes break and adds a tickmark to showcase the first work segment has been done.

When the short break segment ends, the timer returns for another work segment.

When the forth work segment is completed, the timer switches to a long 20 minutes break.

After the long break is done, the work segment begins again.
